# Side Project Visual Progress Enhancement

I want to make the side project (escape plan) progress more visual and engaging.

## Current State
- Side project progress exists (0-100%)
- Displayed as text percentage in side project panel
- Progress tracked in GameManager
- HUSTLE action adds progress

## What I Want
Make the progress more visual - maybe a progress bar or something similar that makes the escape plan feel more tangible and motivating.

## Questions for You
Before implementing, I need you to:

1. **Check current implementation**
   - What does the side project panel look like now?
   - What UI components already exist?
   - How is progress currently displayed?

2. **Design options**
   - What are some visual options for showing progress? (progress bar, gauge, other ideas?)
   - What fits the retro terminal aesthetic?
   - Should it be subtle or prominent?

3. **Implementation approach**
   - Can we reuse existing progress bar components?
   - What files need to change?
   - How many commits should this be broken into?

4. **Any gotchas**
   - What UI patterns are already used in the codebase?
   - Are there theme/styling constraints I should know about?

## Important
- Follow the small, incremental commit pattern (20-100 lines)
- Check existing code first before suggesting new implementations
- Ask clarifying questions if design direction is unclear
- Reference the memory file (.claude/task-category-implementation-summary.md) for codebase patterns

Ask me questions and gather context before proposing a plan!
