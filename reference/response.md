Techniques I Can Help With
1. Game Design Canvas (Quick Start)
A one-page framework covering:
Core loop (what do you DO every 30 seconds/minute?)

1. plan
2. allocating "ducks" to do job or build startup
3. code
4. deal with consequence
5. repeat

Player goals & motivations
Escape from corporate hell by building a startup

Key tensions/interesting choices
job or startup
miss deadline or ship poor code
users or revenue
help coworker or blame them
fix bug or do nothing get slow by it

Win/loss conditions
win - built a startup with enough revenue to quit job
loss - golden handcuff (promoted to management), get fired

Progression arc
at job: jr -> mid -> snr -> management
at startup: 0 users, 0 revenue -> X
helpers (ai, co-workers) to be able to do more?

2. Fun Analysis
We systematically analyze:
What feels tedious right now?
Where are the interesting decisions? (Or where are they missing?)
What creates tension vs. what creates frustration?
Are there "fake choices" (choices that don't matter)?

3. Reference Game Breakdown
Pick 2-3 games you want to feel like, and we extract:
What's the 30-second loop in Papers Please?
What makes "one more turn" work in Balatro/Slay the Spire?
How does Return of the Obra Dinn make inspection fun?
4. Prototyping on Paper
We design the game as if it were a card/board game first:
No UI complexity, just core mechanics
Can you explain the fun in 3 sentences?
Would this be fun as a physical game?
Questions to Start
Let me ask you some diagnostic questions:
What part feels closest to fun right now? (Even if it's not quite there yet)
What's the fantasy? When you imagine someone playing this and having fun, what are they actually doing in that moment?
Reference games: You mentioned Papers Please + Office Space. What specific moments from those inspire you?
Papers Please: The satisfaction of catching discrepancies? The moral choices? The time pressure?
Office Space: The corporate satire? The passive resistance? The heist?
Current pain points: What feels most "off" about the current design?
Is the WORK action boring?
Are the consequences of SHIP IT not interesting enough?
Is the death spiral too fast or too slow?
Is there not enough agency/control?
Core tension: What should be the hard decision the player makes every turn?
My recommendation: Let's start with Fun Analysis + the diagnostic questions above. Once I understand what's not working, we can use one of the structured frameworks to redesign from first principles. What resonates with you? And which of those diagnostic questions jumps out as most important?

Diagnostic Questions for THIS Design
1. The Core Loop Timing
You list 5 steps. How long should one full cycle take?
30 seconds? (fast, arcadey)
actually, the loop is more like
allocate, code, ship, repeat
2. The Duck Allocation
This seems like the core mechanic. Let me probe:
Do you allocate ducks at the START of each day/cycle?
Can you change allocation mid-cycle or are you locked in?
What happens if you put 0 ducks in job work? (Immediate consequences or slow burn?)

Every day, you can allocate 8 ducks.
So 8 ducks o Job, would mean a full day of work will be done.
Cant change during the day.
But maybe there might be random interruptions that will impact the allocation that day.

Is it a slider (60% job, 40% startup) or discrete units (3 ducks here, 2 there)?
Discrete, but slider could be helper


3. The "Coding" Step
This is the black box right now. What is the player actually doing?
hmm maybe code isn't a thing -> just start the day once allocation is done.
is that sufficient?

4. Consequences - Punishment or Opportunity?
"Deal with consequence" - is this:
Reactive (fix the mess you made)?
Strategic (exploit the situation)?
Narrative (see how your choices ripple)?
depending on the task, and the number of ducks allocation, it may need to bugs/outage, impact users numbers, promoted 

5. The Startup Side
This is underdeveloped in your sketch. For the startup:
Do you pick what to build? (Or is it fixed?)
Is there a market/competition?
How do users vs revenue create tension? (Different paths to same goal, or competing resources?)
yeah - there is more choice on what to build, where as in the job mode, you are assigned task with no choice
no market/competition - maybe just random scripted/events
maybe some random award tney can enter
users vs revenue as determine by what features they player decides on

6. What's FUN?
In your imagination, what's the satisfying moment? The moment that makes you go "hell yes, nailed it"?
devs find it relatable and wants to replay it to unlock different endings

Successfully balancing job/startup for a week?
Screwing over a coworker to save yourself?
Shipping a startup feature and seeing users spike?
Barely avoiding getting fired while building in secret?

All of those are valid and are potential achievements/endings

Exercise: The Napkin Pitch
Try to complete this sentence:
"It's a game about [verb-ing] where you constantly have to choose between [A] and [B], and the fun comes from [specific moment/feeling]."

It's a game about escaping corporate hell where you constanty have to choose between day job or escape plan and the fun comes when you have to juggle meeting deadlines vs shipping bad code
