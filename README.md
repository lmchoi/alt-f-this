*"Office Space meets Universal Paperclips with duck-based resource allocation"*

A darkly comedic strategy game where you're a developer trapped in corporate hell, secretly building a startup on company time. Allocate your hours between soul-crushing job tasks and your escape plan. Ship buggy code to meet deadlines. Try not to get caught.

## Running the Game

1. Open the project in **Godot 4.5**
2. Press **F5**

That's it. Main scene is `scenes/game_ui.tscn`.

## How to Play

Each day you split **8 ducks** 🦆 (hours) between your job and your startup, then watch the day play out.

**The loop:**
1. **Allocate** — how many ducks on job vs startup today?
2. **Day runs** — rare events interrupt (~25% of days)
3. **Results** — see how much progress you made
4. **Ship decision** — task ready? Ship now (adds bugs) or wait (risks deadline)?
5. **Next day**

**Win** by completing your app and saving $3K, or getting it to $50/day revenue.

**Lose** by getting fired (missed deadlines), getting caught hustling 3 times, or getting promoted to management.

## The Ducks

Ducks 🦆 = fucks to give. You always have 8. They're time, not health.

More ducks on startup = faster progress, but higher chance of getting caught (10–70% depending on allocation). Three strikes and you're fired.
