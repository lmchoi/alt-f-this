# Future Ideas: 8/10 → 10/10

Ideas to elevate the game from "genuinely fun" to "unforgettable cult classic" after core loop is proven.

---

## 1. Task Variety (Break Repetition)

Different task types = different mini-games during 60s timer:
- **Fix Bug**: Literal whack-a-mole
- **Design Work**: Pattern matching (Papers Please stamping)
- **Meeting**: Dialogue tree while timer runs (multitask)
- **Code Review**: Spot-the-difference under pressure

Each task type feels mechanically different, not just different text.

---

## 2. Escalating Chaos (Not Just More Bugs)

**New interrupt types:**
- Week 1: Text messages (click dismiss)
- Week 2: Video calls (block screen space)
- Week 3: Screen-share (boss watches, can't HUSTLE)
- Week 4: Emergency meetings (lose entire 60s)

**Environmental hazards:**
- Coffee spill (disables keys for 10s)
- Fire alarm (screen shake)
- Coworker visit (blocks screen)

---

## 3. Named NPCs (Emotional Attachment)

**Persistent coworkers with personalities:**

**SARAH (new hire)**
- Asks for help constantly
- Ignore her → she gets fired, you see empty desk
- Help her → she covers for you later

**MARCUS (fellow hustler)**
- Building own side project
- Can share tips (boost hustle)
- Might quit first, become competitor in Act 2

**JENNIFER (manager)**
- Tracks your patterns
- Micromanages if suspicious
- Can be won over or becomes enemy

Relationships affect both acts. Your Act 1 choices haunt/help Act 2.

## 4. Replayability Hooks

**Meta-progression:**
- Unlock perks for future runs (start with 500 users)
- Learn NPC patterns (Marcus always quits day 15)
- Achievements unlock harder modes

**Multiple strategies:**
- Corporate grind (optimize WORK, minimize bugs)
- Hustler (all-in side project, high risk)
- Chaos agent (sabotage, get severance)
- Social (build relationships, get promoted/poached)

**Speedrun potential:** "Escape in 10 days" vs "Maximize profit"

---

## 5. Sound Design (Cheap Juice)

**Escalating stress:**
- Slack "ding" distorts as bugs increase
- Typing speeds up as timer runs low
- Boss voice gets angrier (distortion)
- Hold music when on call

**Breakage:**
- Screen crackle when losing ducks
- UI glitches when caught hustling
- Mouse cursor lags at high bug count

---

## 6. The "Caught" Scene (Shareable Moment)

Make getting caught MEMORABLE:
- Boss makes you open laptop
- YOUR side project visible on screen
- Slow zoom on face
- "Clean out your desk" - interactive
- Drag personal items to box while coworkers watch
- Painful, guilt-inducing, unforgettable

Creates "I can't believe that happened" moment.

---

## 7. Act 2 Callbacks (Narrative Payoff)

**Connections between acts:**
- Hire SARAH (if you helped her in Act 1)
- Compete vs MARCUS (if he quit before you)
- OLD BOSS messages asking for job
- One employee named "YOU" building competitor
- Your Act 1 playstyle affects Act 2 difficulty

**The cycle is visible:** Do you fire yourself?

---

## 8. Branching Discoveries

Mid-run unlocks that change strategy:
- Week 2: Discover slush fund (risky cash)
- Week 3: Company is failing (bail early?)
- Week 4: Competitor offers job (new escape)

Each run teaches something for next run (not just "play better").

---

## 9. Meta-Horror Touch

**The game remembers:**
- Close mid-day → "Boss noticed you disappeared. -2 ducks"
- Creates real guilt for rage-quitting
- Breaks fourth wall subtly

---

## Priority Order (After Core Loop Works)

**Phase 1 (biggest impact/effort ratio):**
1. Named NPCs + relationships
2. Sound design
3. "Caught" scene

**Phase 2 (depth):**
4. Task variety mini-games
5. Meta-progression/unlocks
6. Act 2 callbacks

**Phase 3 (polish):**
7. Escalating chaos events
8. Branching discoveries
9. Meta-horror touches

---

**Current target: 8/10** (real-time core loop, HUSTLE mechanics, Act 1 complete)

**10/10 requires:** Emotional attachment (NPCs), mechanical variety (mini-games), narrative payoff (Act 2 callbacks)
