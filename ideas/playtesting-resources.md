## How to Ask for Feedback

### Good Post Template
```
"Code Monkey, Code" - Papers Please meets Office Space

You're a dev trapped in corporate hell. Inspect tickets,
make impossible decisions, escape before bugs kill you.

Testing core mechanics: Does the death spiral feel fair?
Is shipping buggy code tempting enough?

Looking for feedback on: [specific questions]
```

### Tips
- **Specific questions** get better feedback than "thoughts?"
- Ask 2-3 targeted questions:
  - "Is SHIP IT button tempting?"
  - "Does the death spiral feel fair?"
  - "Are deadlines creating tension?"
