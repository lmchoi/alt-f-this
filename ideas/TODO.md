# TODO

## ðŸ”§ In Progress

**Refactoring game architecture:**
- âœ… Centralized day advancement in `process_turn()`
- âœ… Moved day increment into `daily_updates()` (single place)
- ðŸš§ Moving game logic out of property setters
- ðŸš§ Adding state machine (PLAYER_TURN vs AWAITING_INPUT)
- ðŸš§ Splitting event checks (daily events vs game over conditions)

## ðŸ“‹ Next Features

1. Escape progress (HUSTLE builds 0-100%, enables alternate victory)
2. Post-ship choice screen (ACCEPT TASK vs HUSTLE)
3. Random event when beg for mercy
4. Need indicator for time bombs?

## âœ… Completed

1. âœ… Payday system (payment every 5 days)
2. âœ… Task difficulty scaling by job level
3. âœ… Completed tasks counter
4. âœ… End game stats and structured endings
5. âœ… Overdue firing (3 days overdue = fired)
