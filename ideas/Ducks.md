Here’s your revamped **Alt+F+This** game summary, now with 100% more existential duck economy:  

---

# **ALT+F+THIS**  
*A darkly comedic sim about surviving the corporate grind—and the ducks you lose along the way.*  

### **THE PREMISE**  
You’re trapped in a tech job hellscape. Your goal? Escape with $5K—or lose every last duck you give.  

---

### **ACT 1: CORPORATE PRISON**  
**(Ducks vs. Dollars)**  
- **💰 Salary:** $500 every 5 days.  
- **🦆 Ducks to Give:** Your dwindling will to live (start with 5).  

#### **TASKS** *(Each chips away at your soul—or ducks)*  
| Task | Deadline | Duck Cost | Consequence |  
|------|----------|----------|-------------|  
| *Debug TPS Reports* | 3 days | -0 🦆 | None (you’re numb to this) |  
| *Lie to Customers* | 2 days | -1 🦆 | Coworkers judge you |  
| *Fire Intern* | NOW | -3 🦆 | One duck **quits in protest** |  

#### **ACTIONS**  
- **Work:** Progress task, earn $.  
- **Hustle:** +50% cash, -1 🦆 (*"You monster."*)  
- **Cry in Bathroom:** +2 🦆, but lose half a day.  

#### **OFFICE EVENTS**  
- **CEO’s "Fun" Mandatory Pizza Party**  
  - ✅ *Fake enthusiasm*: -1 🦆, +$100 "culture bonus"  
  - ❌ *Refuse*: Sent to HR, duck theft investigation  

- **HR Asks for Feedback**  
  - ✅ *"Everything’s great!"*: Promotion, -2 🦆  
  - ❌ *Tell the truth*: Demoted, +1 🦆 (but salary halved)  

#### **ESCAPE CONDITIONS**  
- **🏆 Freedom:** Save $5K (proceed to **Act 2: Startup Chaos**).  
- **⛓ Golden Handcuffs:** Salary hits $2.5K/5 days → Ducks evolve into *corporate drones*.  
- **🔥 Get Fired:** Miss deadlines → *Exit interview with your last duck as witness*.  
- **🦆 Duck Bankruptcy:** Run out of ducks → *You automate your job and become empty inside*.  

---

### **ACT 2: STARTUP CHAOS**  
*(Now with duck-based guilt!)*  
- **Found a company.** Will you:  
  - **Exploit workers**? (Ducks unionize against you.)  
  - **Empower team**? (Ducks return… but VCs hate you.)  
- **Duck Economy:** Employees demand *more ducks* (PTO, dignity).  

---

### **ACT 3: RECKONING**  
- **Frostpunk-style recap:**  
  - *Ducks lost vs. dollars earned.*  
  - *"You had 5 ducks. You buried 3."*  
- **Secret Endings:**  
  - **Duck CEO:** You replace the boss. The cycle continues.  
  - **Duck Revolution:** Office is overrun. HR flees.  

---

### **WHY IT WORKS**  
- **Ducks = instant meme appeal** (Twitch bait: *"SAVE THE DUCKS!"*).  
- **No sanity bar** → Suffering is *felt*, not quantified.  
- **Systemic humor:** The ducks get darker as you do (*"Your last duck writes a suicide note in Comic Sans."*).  

---  

**FINAL PITCH:**  
*"Papers, Please meets Untitled Goose Game—with 100% more capitalist dread."*  

Would you add:  
1) **Duck customization** (hats, rage-quit animations), or  
2) **A secret duck god** (final boss: the CEO’s pet goose)?
